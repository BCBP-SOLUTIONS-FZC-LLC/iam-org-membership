# Events/outbox/dedup CI gate: reject any application code that talks to
# SNS/SQS directly, or hand-builds an events.Envelope, instead of going
# through platform-events.
#
# The only legitimate way to publish is Publisher.Enqueue
# (internal/adapter/outbound/eventbus/publisher.go, which calls
# outbox.Enqueue(ctx, tx, env)); the only legitimate way to send to SNS is
# events.NewSNSPublisher (cmd/server/main.go's buildTopicPublisher); the
# only legitimate way to consume from SQS is events.NewSQSConsumerWithClient
# (cmd/server/main.go). cmd/server/main.go is the one place allowed to
# construct a raw *sqs.Client — solely to hand it to
# events.NewSQSConsumerWithClient — and it must never call a transport
# method on it directly. There is deliberately no sns.NewFromConfig call
# anywhere in this repo — events.NewSNSPublisher builds its own SNS client
# internally.
#
# internal/adapter/outbound/eventbus/ is exempt from the transport-method
# check (#2) below: RoutingPublisher's own Publish/PublishBatch methods call
# through to the wrapped events.Publisher (platform-events' own interface,
# built via events.NewSNSPublisher) — same method names as the raw AWS SDK
# client, but the sanctioned call, not a bypass. Mirrors the identical
# exemption in check-outbox-access.sh for the same package.
#
# Consumer-side dedup (processed_events) is intentionally NOT covered here:
# platform-events has no consumer-side idempotency mechanism (only the
# publish-side, SNS-FIFO-only WithMessageDeduplicationID), so hand-rolling
# that table is the correct pattern, not a bypass.
#
# Test files are exempt: e2e/integration tests legitimately talk to SNS/SQS
# directly to simulate external actors (Realm Provisioner, Billing, ...)
# that this service does not own.

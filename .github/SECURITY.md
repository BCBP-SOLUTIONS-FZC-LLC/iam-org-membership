## Scope

Areas of particular sensitivity in this service:

- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** — tenant isolation enforced at the Postgres layer; a bypass would expose cross-tenant user profiles.
- **GUC injection** — `app.tenant_id` and `app.user_id` are set per-request via `GUCBridgeMiddleware`; incorrect values would allow privilege escalation.
- **Signature S3 keys** — `signature_key` is a bare S3 object key used by the Approver workflow; exposure could allow forged approvals.
- **LLM context** — `GET /internal/users/:id/llm-context` is consumed by the RAG & Generation Service; injection here could influence AI-generated output.
- **Outbox payloads** — event payloads are validated against JSON Schemas before insert; a bypass could propagate malformed data to downstream consumers.
